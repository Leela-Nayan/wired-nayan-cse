# level 19-20

1. This level was also pretty easy, or so I thought. The challenge asked me to just run the setuid binary, but I didn't know how. I opened the resource that was mentioned below (the wikipedia page) and saw that they were running it like running C programs using GCC in the terminal (using ./)

2. So I ran ./bandit20-do and it asked me to run another command.
3. So I ran ./bandit20-do ls and it worked. 
4. So next I ran ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20, and I got the password.
