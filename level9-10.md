# level 9-10

At first, I tried to use the nano editor and the "find" option in that, but that didn't work out I have no idea why. Then I read the "commands you may need to solve this level" and started to go through the man pages of every command listed there. I just saw the first line of man page of strings and knew this would work, because it would print only the printable characters of the txt file, so i just ran strings data.txt and voila, I just scrolled up a bit and found the password. But maybe, I could've also used a combination of grep (current thought, didn't occur at that time), would have been easier.

Commnands used: strings data.txt
