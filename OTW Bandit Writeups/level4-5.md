# level 4-5

For this level though, I used some of my prior knowledge. I had tinkered around a lot with a raspi, so I knew this already. To find the human readable file, it was just file ./* which would print the data types of all the files in the current directory. from there, it was only one file with ascii text, so I just printed its contents using cat ./-file07, which also again prints all the contents inside the file07.
